Magnetohydrodinamical waves with boundary conditions using Dedalus

This repo is about my final graduate project at Universitat de les Illes Balears (UIB). It contains some python notebooks including the ones to test and learn the Dedalus library.

The main goal of this project is to learn and take advantage of this useful tool to solve the PDE obtained when the equations of ideal MHD are linearized, among other assumptions described in the memory of the project.

This equations represent the dynamics of the normal modes of a wave propagating in a solar prominence at the solar corona and a which can be treated as 2D bounded system. There are mainly three modes: the Alfvén modes, which propagate just as a guitar string with non continous density (1D), and the fast & slow modes, which couple the movement in the two dimensions involved.
