Magnetohydrodinamical waves with boundary conditions using Dedalus

This repo is about my final graduate project at Universitat de les Illes Balears (UIB). It contains some python notebooks including the ones to test and learn how to use the Dedalus library.

The main goal of this project is to learn and take advantage of this useful tool to solve the PDE obtained with the linearization of the equations of ideal MHD, among some other assumptions described in the memory of the project.

This equations represent the dynamics of the normal modes of a wave propagating in a solar prominence at the solar corona, which conforms a 3D bounded system. However, there are two sets of equations which are uncoupled and can be separated by three modes: the Alfv√©n modes, which propagate just as a guitar string with non continous density (1D), and the Fast & Slow modes, which couple the movement in the two remaining dimensions.
